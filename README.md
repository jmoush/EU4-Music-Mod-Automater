# MicroProj
# Compile:

 Compile the code in Visual Studio.
 
 The program was created using Visual Studio 2022 (v143) using C++17 on Windows SDK version 10.0.
 
 Tested on windows 10 pc and only works with windows given the use of windows only commands.  

# How to use:
A directory on the desktop with named "OGG" (not case-sensitive) must exist or the program will crash.

The OGG folder must contain .ogg files that are formatted in 44.1 KHz sample rate and 192 kbps in order to function inside EU4.

The program will create a folder on the desktop called "Music Files" which contains the asset and txt files necessary for the music mod.

# Known crashes to be fixed:

Not having a folder called ogg on the desktop

Special characters in the file names cause the program to crash.

Thank you for using this free software that I made to add couple hundred of songs to EU4 without tedious hassle.
