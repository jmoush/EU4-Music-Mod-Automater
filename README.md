# MicroProj
#Tested on windows 10 pc and only works with windows given the use of windows only commands.  
#A directory on the desktop with named "OGG" (not case-sensitive) must exist or the program will crash.
#The OGG folder must contain .ogg files that are formatted in 44.1 KHz sample rate and 192 kbps in order to function inside EU4.
#The program will create a folder on the desktop called "Music Files" which contains the asset and txt files necessary for the music mod.
#Known crashes to be fixed:
#Not having a folder called ogg on the desktop
#Special characters in the file names cause the program to crash.
#Thank you for using this free software that I made to add couple hundred of songs to EU4 without tedious hassle.
